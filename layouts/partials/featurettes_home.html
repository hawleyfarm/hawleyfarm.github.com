  {{$description := "If you've never considered a farm holiday, let us give you an idea of what to expect. Scattered on our fields are our cows, young stock and sheep; if you are interested to see the milking and see the animals at close hand, we can arrange a guided farm tour for you. You can also meander through the Blackdown Hills where you can spot all sorts of wildlife, there are many footpaths right from your door. Visit one of the many historical and cultural sights of East Devon or stay on the farm where you can learn all about our dairy, milk and beef farming over a cake and a cup of tea."}}
