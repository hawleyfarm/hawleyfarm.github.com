We have just returned from a week staying in the Cider Press.<br>
It is a lovely cottage - spotlessly clean, well furnished &amp; in such a lovely spot. It was so enjoyable just to sit at the table and watch what was happening outside - &amp; there was always something going on. Its a nice walk across the fields to the village of Dalwood. We would suggest that if you want to eat at the village pub (The Tuckers Arms) that you do book a table. We would also recommend the River Cottage Canteen in Axminster. All in all a very relaxing and entertaining week &amp; certainly a cottage we would recommend to friends and family.</p>

We would all like to thank you for the lovely holiday. We stayed in the Cider Press. The highlight of the week was the tour around the Farm. The accommodation was 1st class,as were the scones. We have recommended you to our freinds, and hope to stay with you again soon</p>

Best accommodation and hosts ever! The Wagon House is beautifully appointed and so tastefully converted Peaceful and very rural but really close to beautiful beaches and pretty market towns Graham and Pamela are very welcoming and discreet The bonus is the adorable dog who visits hopefully but is just as happy with a tummy tickle! Thankyou for such a brilliant holiday and have already started recommending you to friends</p>

My daughter booked Cider Press Cottage as a surprise weekend for his 60th birthday and couldnt have made a better choice! The six of us were made very welcome and all our immediate needs were provided tea bags provided and milk in the fridge not to mention the delicious complimentary cream tea! Everything you might need is here and plenty more besides. The local pub is within walking distance and serves good food. We only wish we had been able to spend longer here we definitely need to arrange a return visit. Thoroughly recommended.</p>

(Dec 27-31)We spent four fantastic nights at the Wagon House between Christmas and New Year. We have two young boys who absolutely loved the farm and the animals. The accommodation was comfortable and stylish, with a grandstand view of the farm. Best of all though was the kindness, generosity and warmth of Pamela, Graham and their sons (we met all three!) - nothing was too much trouble and they involved us in the activities of the farm whenever they could (new born lambs, milking and delivering sheep) - we will definitely try and return.</p>

This was a first visit to Wagon House (but it wont be our last), we had a lovely week from 7/7/12. Place is great and very well equipt, we had everything we needed. Some great walks from the farm, loved the one that included Burrow Gardens and nice to be able to walk to the pub.</p>

We had a fab time here! Quiet, luxurious, very new and well kept, thoughtful cottages, with great walking and also close to wonderful jurassic beaches, and coastline. Stayed a week after researching many places, and this cottage is even better than the pics!! Thoroughly recommend - one week in Feb 2012 we stayed!</p>

Our holiday experience totally exceeded our expectations! We found (at last) our perfect UK holiday. The Barn was beautifully appointed and felt like home instantly, the level of attention to detail, fit, finish and comfort was first class nothing could be faulted. The atmosphere was relaxed, comfortable and very tranquil. Pamela, Graham and the boys really made the holiday for us as they are so frendly and helpful and it was a wonderful experience to see the milking and the calves being fed. We bought our mountain bikes with us and there are loads of rides starting at the farm and very little traffic. East Devon has wonderful countryside and we will be back soon!

Thanks very much for a great week in the Wagon House - it was a lovely location and we all very much enjoyed our break! Thank you Graham for the tour around the farm - it was very interesting and it was nice for me as a Cornish man to see cows, hedges and grass instead of flat fields of wheat!!<br>
Laura and I would love to come down and stay again at some point soon as there was much that we did not have time for! It would also be a good location to meet up with my Mum &amp; Dad instead of having a 6hr drive back to Lands End !!<br>
Thanks again<br>

We had a wonderful holiday in the Cider Press. It is very well equipped with everything you could need as well as being very comfortable. It is in a beautiful position on the farm with lots of lovely walks all around. Graham and Pamela could not have made us feel more welcome and we really enjoyed looking around the farm. We all agreed we’d love to go again because we felt so much at home and there are still plenty of places to explore.</p>

10th October 2010 - Our stay at the Wagon House was fantastic. A perfect, tranquil setting. The place certainly has the WOW factor. Well equipped, everything you could possibly need and we didn’t want to leave. An ideal place for touring not only East Devon but also the beautiful Dorset coast. Will certainly return.</p>

We had a fantastic family holiday here - Graham and Pamela were great hosts and went out of their way to let us experience farm life first hand. Wherever we went our girls insisted that we had to be back in time to feed the calves! We stayed in the Cider Press and it was lovely - a very comfortable home from home with everything we could possibly want. None of us wanted to leave when the time came and we will definitely be back next year to see how the calves that were born during our stay are progressing.</p>

staying at The Cider Press on Hawley Farm was like staying in a 5 star hotel.Pam and Graham have put alot more than just hard work into making The Cider Press what it is today. We have stayed at many properties in Devon over many years and this property tops them all. The children had great fun in going in the land rover over to milk the cows, not something children from Reigate do or see everyday.We wish you both good luck and have already told many friends that we had a wonderful time at Hawley Farm with the children not wanting to leave.keep doing what you have done, it works !</p>
