      <description>March 2019 March for us arrived like a lamb with light showers after the dry warm February, sometimes it was like summer
The guests leaving after their half term holiday have had a great time enjoying the beautiful weather and we think this is a lovely time to come away on holiday for many reasons.
The Daffodils are all out, Primroses and the Hawthorn in the hedges.
Finding fossils at Lyme regis and Charmouth can be easy this time of year as with the winter weather there is more uncovered.</description>

      <description>Walking the many footpaths, that are right from your door when you stay at Hawley Farm.
There are five walks that have been timed so you can plan your day and they all pass the Tuckers Arms pub in the village of Dalwood where you will be able to have a rest with food and drink if you arrive at lunch time or from six in the evening, or the small village shop where you can buy an ice cream.</description>
