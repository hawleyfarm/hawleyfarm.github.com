      <description>April 2019 The blackthorn continues to flower and so the cold weather remains, sunny in the day, but cold at night, with frosts, not much rain, so the spring flowers are still looking great and lasting longer than normal.
I would say it has been a super spring and every thing has been looking lovely. We are now in the Easter Holidays and lovely to see children who are interested in what goes on in the countryside.</description>

      <description>March 2019 March for us arrived like a lamb with light showers after the dry warm February, sometimes it was like summer
The guests leaving after their half term holiday have had a great time enjoying the beautiful weather and we think this is a lovely time to come away on holiday for many reasons.
The Daffodils are all out, Primroses and the Hawthorn in the hedges.
Finding fossils at Lyme regis and Charmouth can be easy this time of year as with the winter weather there is more uncovered.</description>

      <description>Walking the many footpaths, that are right from your door when you stay at Hawley farm.
There are five walks that have been timed so you can plan your day and they all pass the Tuckers Arms pub in the village of Dalwood where you will be able to have a rest with food and drink if you arrive at lunch time or from six in the evening, or the small village shop where you can buy an ice cream.</description>

Whether you enjoy cycling, walking, surfing or just fancy a pint in the local pub, there are plenty of treasures waiting on Hawley Farm&amp;rsquo;s doorstep.</description>

      <description>February 2019 As the snow melted the sheep found their green grass again to eat. Many sheep keep the fields tidy in the winter when most of the cattle are not to be seen as they winter in the warm sheds, being fed the silage that had been made in the summer.
Some ewes have already had their lambs and can be seen in the fields with their mothers, you may think it is too cold for them but as long as their mums give them a good helping of milk to fill their bellys, they are fine out in the cold with their mums.</description>
