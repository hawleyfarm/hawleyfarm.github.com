      <description>Hawley Farm
We arrived at Hawley Farm in 1984 and milked a herd of cows on the small farm, we had fun and games in bad weather when the milk tanker came to collect the milk and the cake lorry tried to deliver. The hill and the oak trees were not helping us getting large lorries in and out when the snow is on the ground, we can tell you some more stories when you arrive for your holiday!</description>

      <description>April 2019 The blackthorn continues to flower and so the cold weather remains, sunny in the day, but cold at night, with frosts, not much rain, so the spring flowers are still looking grand and lasting longer than normal.
I would say it has been a super spring and every thing has been looking lovely. We are now in the Easter Holidays and lovely to see children who are interested in what goes on in the countryside.</description>

      <description>February 2019 As the snow melted the sheep found their green grass again to eat. Many sheep keep the East Devon fields tidy in the winter when most of the cattle are not to be seen as they winter in the warm sheds on the farm, being fed the silage that had been made in the summer close to the village of Dalwood.
Some ewes on the Devon Farm have already had their lambs and can be seen in the fields with their mothers, you may think it is too cold for them but as long as their mums give them a good helping of milk to fill their bellys, they are fine out in the cold with their mums.</description>

      <description>July 2019 July has gone on record as the hottest month so far; the sun shone and the rain stayed away, even when thunder and lightning were nearby.
So the fields have become brown and dry, with very little grass growth only in the shade is there any green grass. The cows are given a large run of a few fields and have some silage feed on the ground. Half of the herd have been dried up, so are not milking, they are on their rest period before they calve at the end of August.</description>

      <description>June 2019 Although the rain came and came, we were pleased to see the much-needed rain as it had been very dry. However, like all good things, it went on a little too long, and we soon hoped for sun, to get to the second cut silage! In the last week, the good weather returned and the silage was cut the second time. The crop was so much better due to the rain.</description>
