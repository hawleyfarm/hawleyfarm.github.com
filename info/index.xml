      <description>Walking the many footpaths, that are right from your door when you stay at Hawley Farm self catering holiday cottages near Axminster and Honiton.
There are five walks that have been timed so you can plan your day and they all pass the Tuckers Arms pub in the village of Dalwood where you will be able to have a rest with food and drink if you arrive at lunch time or from six in the evening, or the small village shop where you can buy an ice cream.</description>
