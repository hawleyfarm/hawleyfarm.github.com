JUNE

Well the rain came and came and we were pleased to see the much needed rain as it was very dry so very welcome. However like all good things it went on a little too long the dull days were over cast and we then, as it continued, we hoped for sun, to get to the second cut silage! The last week the good weather returned and the silage was cut the second time and the crop was so much better due to the rain.

In the worst of the weather I had guests returning to walk the coastal path, athough it did not look that good that week with much rain, but they achieved their goal! Most of the  paths are very well drained and some are under trees so with the right clothing and boots they had a good week as the accommodation is very comfortable and when coming with family and friends the open plan living in the East Devon holiday cottages makes for a lovely social time, catching up on old times.

Eating and drinking together is lovely to see happy familys meeting up and sitting out in the sun on the long summer days. June ended with the last week or two with lovely sunny weather again.... One of my lovely returning guests took a trip down to Brixam where all the fish come in, found it very interesting and then took a trip back over Dartmoor, traveling back over the moor there was no others around only the ponies and sheep, you can pick up the atmosphere of the moor, returning back to Hawley holiday cottage at 10.30, it was still light. A lovely memorable day was had with the family.
