#### June

Although the rain came and came, we were pleased to see the much-needed rain as it had been very dry. However, like all good things, it went on a little too long, and we soon hoped for sun, to get to the second cut silage! In the last week, the good weather returned and the silage was cut the second time. The crop was so much better due to the rain. Farming is very dependant on the weather.

In the worst of the weather, I had guests returning to walk the Jurassic coastal path, although it did not look that good that week with much rain, they achieved their goal! Most of the paths are very well-drained and some are under trees so with the right clothing and boots they had a good week as the accommodation is very comfortable and when coming with family and friends the open plan living in the East Devon holiday cottages makes for a lovely social time, catching up on old times and making new plans for the future!

It is lovely to see families meeting up, eating and drinking together, and sitting out in the sun on the long summer days. June ended with the last week with lovely sunny weather again. One of my lovely returning guests took a trip down to Brixham where all the fish came in. After this interesting encounter, they went to Dartmoor. On their return there were no others around just the ponies and sheep, giving a tranquil atmosphere to the moor. Despite returning back to Hawley holiday cottage at 10:30 pm, it was still light. A lovely memorable day for the family.
