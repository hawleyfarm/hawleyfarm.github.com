MAY

After checking the sheep this evening at 9.30 pm they are still busy eating, blairing and not at all sleepy the lambs are running around. This morning they were all very sleepy at 8.30am when walking through them they do not even get up. Sheep start the day late morning. I like to think it is very peaceful here but when a lamb or two, may be a twin of lambs like to go for explore which they do, finding small holes that they can scwees through as they are mischivous and interested there may be some young shoots that may be sweet to eat. When they find themselves parted from their mother they try and get back but not sure where they got in and then the blaaring starts then Mother starts and the peaceful location I tell people  it is not until they are reunited. This happenens over and over again. As they grow this will stop, it is great to see them running around and jumping in the air, like a lamb on springs.

The leaves are out and the trees look great, bright shiny it is a lovely time of year, the bluebells are everywhere with many others flowers, wild garlic little violets, the weather has been dry a little cold.

Have just cut for silage the is is early as the spring has been good.
