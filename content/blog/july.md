JULY

July has gone on record as the hottest month so far so the the sun shone and the rain stayed away even when the thunder and lightning happened we missed the rain.

So the fields have become brown and dry, with very little grass growth only in the shade is there any green grass. The cows are given a large run of a few fields and have some silage feed on the ground. Half of the herd have been dried up, so are not milking, they are on their rest period before they calf at the end of August.

The lambs have been weaned from the ewes as they are at an age where the can eat the grass and do not need mothers milk any more, this give the mothers a rest period also, as it has been said "there comes a time where little ones must fly the nest" as it were. So following and calling to mother has stopped and all in very quiet after that initial day!

The children have their school holidays so we have families that come from far and wide.  Familys from Europe have arrived and say they love the area and had a good journey to get here in our lovely part of East Devon.  We find it very interesting to meeting people from far a field. Driving our country lanes is and experience for them and the peace and quiet at the holiday cottages.

On the farm we had a crop of wheat which we decided to clamp for extra feed for the winter as prospects for a third cut were slim and this would be a good feed. It is a corn crop that is cut before it is fully ripe and is clamped just like grass to make silage. There is alot of forage maize growing in the area and seems to be growing well in the hot weather.

We are ending the month of July again like in May on a very dry note, lovely for the beach fans as every day has been a beach day Lyme Regis being the most popular of the many in this area.
