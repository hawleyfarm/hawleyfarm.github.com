August/September/October 2019

Honiton Show had a lovely day on the 1st August, the run of good weather continued.

Beach days a many with the choice of beaches such as Lyme Regis, Seaton, Beer, Branscombe and Sidmouth close to Hawley Farm, for swimming and taking the sun. Dalwood fair also brought in the crowds. Making a splendid day out for all the family when on holiday in East Devon staying on a farm in magnificent accommodation.

On the farm the cows were drying up for their rest period enjoying glorious days laying in the sun.

The calving started on the week of the 21st August so a steady stream of calves began.

They continued into September and October with the pens getting full of calves. The milk in the tank starts to increase.

There was a rainy time with cooler temperatures from around the 21st September. This was a relief as the ground had become very dry. The fields green up again.

The cows start to receive silage for extra feed as the grass loses its value and the cows need extra. feed.

During the second half of October the leaves start to change colour, the fascinating Oak trees really look delightful.
