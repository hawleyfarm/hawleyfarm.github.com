## Booking

**For all new bookings, if Government action concerning Covid 19 results in you being prevented from travelling we will refund all monies paid.**

We are taking booking for this wintertime,  From tiers 1 and 2 areas in groups of a single household or support bubble.. Devon is currently tier 2.

Bookings are managed through Devon Farms, a cooperative of farming holiday providers. Please see the booking form below.

The booking form is restricted to start your booking on a Saturday for Cider Press and Wagon House. The Stables however changes on a Friday, so a 3 or 4 night booking is possible in high season. From October to May, we are happy to relax this restriction, therefore if you would prefer a different period, please ["contact us"](/contact).

We can take payment by cheque, bank transfer and Paypal.
