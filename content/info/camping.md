Walking the many footpaths, that are right from your door when you stay at Hawley farm.

There are five walks that have been  timed so you can plan your day and they all pass the Tuckers Arms pub in the village of Dalwood where you will be able to have a rest with food and drink if you arrive at lunch time or from six in the evening, or the small village shop where you can buy an icecream.

Lovely views of the country side in the Blackdown Hills at any time of the year would make a nice family day.
