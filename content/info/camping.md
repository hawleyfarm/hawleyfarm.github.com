Walking the many footpaths, that are right from your door when you stay at Hawley farm. 

There are five walks that have been  timed so you can plan your day and they all pass the pub where you will be able to have a rest with food and drink, or the small village shop where you can buy an icecream.

Lovely views of the country side in the Blackdown Hills in any time of the year would make a nice family day.
