text="We all know about the baby lambs of spring and Hawley Farm does not disappoint. Watch these fluffy bundles of joy prancing around the fields – guaranteed cuteness that´s sure to bring a smile to your face. There are plenty of cows strolling through the green grasses to look out for too. Spring also brings an abundance of flowers and plants to the farm. From dingling bluebells to bright primrose blooms, why not bring a nature chart for the kids and see what you can see."

title="Summer"
text="See our sheep being sheared and wool being collected. This is also the time of harvesting and silaging so expect smells of fresh grass and barley tingling your senses. Summer is the ideal time to see all of the animals in the fields before they hide away over the chilly winter months."

title="Autumn"
text="Times are a little quieter on the farm in Autumn as the cows go indoors to protect the fields. However, you can still visit them in their warm, new homes and go exploring to see what other secrets the farm holds. We think Hawley is at its most beautiful over Autumn with leaves of all colours falling and plenty to discover in the surrounding countryside."

title="Winter"
text="Over late winter and early spring, it´s time for sheep lambing and you can watch the whole process happen at Hawley Farm. Treat your family to a Devon farm holiday before the festive season and expect baby cows and lambs on the children´s Christmas lists! It´s also a great option if you want to get away for Christmas and New Year or book both and bring all the family with you and have a party away from home! Plan something a little different for your friends or colleagues. The nearby towns have a sense of Christmas spirit and community that you won´t find in any big city."
