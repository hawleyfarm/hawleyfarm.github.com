Walking the many footpaths, that are right from your door when you stay at [Hawley ](https://www.hawleyfarm.co.uk/accommodation/ciderpress/ "accommodation")farm.

There are five walks that have been  timed so you can plan your day and they all pass the Tuckers Arms pub in the village of Dalwood where you will be able to have a rest with food and drink if you arrive at lunch time or from six in the evening, or the small village shop where you can buy an ice cream. You will see the Devon flint stone and thatch houses that were made from what was found and grown in the area.

Lovely views of the country side which is in the Blackdown Hills AONB.  A great way to keep healthy and to see the beauty of the countryside at any time of the year. You will pass the Devon hedgerows that are famous for their wild flowers and wild life, as you turn each corner there could be deer grazing or the sound of a woodpecker in the trees.

There are many other footpaths that go further a field, we have OS maps here for your use, if you want to make a day of it.

If you have a family pet that would enjoy walks in the countryside, well behaved dogs are welcome. When walking it is important that your dog is on a lead as there is livestock in the fields and it is very important that you pick up after your dog and bin in the large bin by the [holiday cottages.](https://www.hawleyfarm.co.uk/accommodation/wagonhouse/ "accommodation")

The village has a vine yard that makes some award winning wine, you will pass, also others sites of interest would be Loughwood Meeting House, this is open and is owned by the National Trust. St Peters church in the centre of the village and the Corry Brook. Beckford Bridge is worth a visit by foot and is a good work out due to the hills. The Shute Armada Beacon House is one of only two remaining in Devon and is on footpath no.5.

If you are in a walking group you could book all three cottages and discover East Devon, the cottages can sleep up 14 in sevon rooms.

Hawley Farm[ holiday accommodation](https://www.hawleyfarm.co.uk/accommodation/stables/ "Accommodation") is a short distance from the coast, so this section of  the South Wast coastal footpath is just right to do while holidaying at Dalwood. If you come with friends and two cars, it works well. Beer through to Branscombe is said to be the best bit of the whole 600 miles round. There is a bus that you can catch if needed.

What ever the time of year it is great to be outside making the most of every day with a good pair of walking boots and coat or sun hat. Then back for a lovely comfortable evening and sleep at Hawley Farm holiday cottages.
