# **COVID 19**

We are pleased to say we will be open for Holiday guests from the 4th July after the lockdown on 23rd March 2020.  An event that will go down in history.

It has been an upsetting time for all of us, but we hope you would like to have a UK holiday here in rural East Devon.

We would like to put your mind at rest, we have been working hard to make a safe environment for your holiday here at Hawley Farm Holiday Accommodation.

With that in mind, there are a few changes that we have had to put in place to allow us more time to clean and sanitise the properties for your stay to ensure the health and safety of us all.

Following these changes, the AA and VisitEngland have granted us certificates confirming that we are _Covid Secure_:

* The AA: ["Covid-19 Confident"](/images/uploads/covid_confident_certificate.pdf)
* VisitEngland: ["We're good to go"](/images/uploads/we-re-good-to-go-certificate.pdf)
* Local Lockdown.  If you have a booked holiday with us here and are unable to come due to a local lock down. Please be assured that we will re book you for another time suitable,  to take your holiday at a later date.

# **Day of arrival**

Your holiday accommodation will be cleaned and sanitised ready for your arrival and you will notice the hand sanitiser at the front entrance, this is for you and all your party to use each time you enter your property. Please can you arrive not before 5pm unless you have been told otherwise.

You will also be advised of your parking space and your open-air leisure space. We ask that you please respect other guests by keeping your party to your designated areas

# **Day of departure**

The departure time for all our properties is now 9.30am prompt.

On the morning of your departure can you please put all your bedding and towels in the linen bags provided and leave in the utility room and please leave a window open in every room, weather permitting

Please note that all farm visits are now canceled until further notice. We are sorry and hope things will change for the better in the near future. The field footpaths are all open however to enjoy.

**Lastly, if any of your party show any symptoms of Covid-19 during your stay, please inform, Pamela, Graham or Annie, immediately.**

We hope you will have a pleasant holiday with us but if you any questions or concerns about a stay, please do not hesitate to contact us.  Telephone 01404831250, 07968155916.
