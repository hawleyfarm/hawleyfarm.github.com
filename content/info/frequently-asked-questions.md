## FAQs

We are very sorry to say we are temporarily closed to having guests stay due to the current situation and are not sure how long this will be.

We wish all our guests and families and all,  can stay safe in this very upsetting time.

If  you would like to book a holiday in the future, please do, however,  we will not be taking any deposits until we are sure it can go ahead. We wait for guidance from the government.

Any holidays already booked and paid for, that cannot take place due to this pandemic will be re booked at a later date of the guests choice. There may be a slight adjustment in price depending what time of year this may be.  Thank you.
