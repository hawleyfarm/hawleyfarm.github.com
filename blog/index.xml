      <description>April 2019 The blackthorn continues to flower and so the cold weather remains, sunny in the day, but cold at night, with frosts, not much rain, so the spring flowers are still looking grand and lasting longer than normal.
I would say it has been a super spring and every thing has been looking lovely. We are now in the Easter Holidays and lovely to see children who are interested in what goes on in the countryside.</description>

      <description>July 2019
July has gone on record as the hottest month so far so the the sun shone and the rain stayed away even when the thunder and lightning happened we missed the rain.
So the fields have become brown and dry, with very little grass growth only in the shade is there any green grass. The cows are given a large run of a few fields and have some silage feed on the ground.</description>

      <description>June 2019 Well, the rain came and came and we were pleased to see the much-needed rain as it was very dry so very welcome. However like all good things it went on a little too long the dull days were overcast and we then, as it continued, we hoped for sun, to get to the second cut silage! The last week the good weather returned and the silage was cut the second time and the crop was so much better due to the rain.</description>
