      <description>February 2019 As the snow melted the sheep found their green grass again to eat. Many sheep keep the fields tidy in the winter when most of the cattle are not to be seen as they winter in the warm sheds, being fed the silage that had been made in the summer.
Some ewes have already had their lambs and can be seen in the fields with their mothers, you may think it is too cold for them but as long as their mums give them a good helping of milk to fill their bellys, they are fine out in the cold with their mums.</description>
